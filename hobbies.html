        <h2>Scuba Diving</h2>
        <p>I found the love for scuba diving a few years ago when I obtained my diving qualification<br/>
        as a way to overcome my fear of the ocean and what lies in the never ending abyss.</p>
        <p>Since then I have definitely overcome that fear and have enjoyed every moment of it, the<br/>
        beauty and absolute tranquility I expereince each and every time is my version of inter<br/>
    planet tourism.</p>
    <p>If you have not given this a go yet, contact me and we can dive together.</p>

<h2>Cycling - road and off-road</h2>
<p>Cycling has always been part of my life, from the social cycling within my local area at a<br/>
young age to competing in various races in my adulthood.</p>
<p>Being part of a team has given me the opportunity to increase on social skills and working<br/>
within a team enviroment which have assisted me in my career. Teamwork is an indispensable<br/>
skill used on a daily basis in every work enviroment whether you are working on-site, hybrid<br/>
or remote, you will need to work with people and being able to work well with others in a team<br/>
enviroment is definitely an asset.</p>
<p>The physical and mental toll a race take on your body and mind teaches you how to overcome<br/>
those limitations you had. Pushing through your limitations and crossing that finish line, beating<br/>
your previous years lap and race time is one of the greatest feelings. This then carries over into<br/>
your professional career, breaking those boundaries and overcome your limitations.</p>
