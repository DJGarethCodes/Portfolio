<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The journey from stone-age dad to Web Developer has been really exciting and colourful. I first fell inlove with coding during a course online in Data Analytics, but this was not the direction that first intrigued my interest in coding.</p>
<p>A few months later while scrolling through the dungeons of  YouTube I stumbled upon a self taught tutorial video where the YouTuber spoke about their journey, this was where the hook took hold</p>
<p> From that day, the day I was practically dying from boredom. That day is the day I really started putting myself into a mindset of achievement, something that I had drifted from over the years. The loss in passion and drive, the return of my OCD was at the fold.</p>
<p>So first things first, I spiral into said YouTubers profile and devour all the information possible. Using said information to conjure up a strategy to achieve my goal of becoming a bonified software engineer by the time I reach the ripe old age of 40! (Starting point - 34yrs old). Setting a target without becoming overwhelmed and dispondent is the key, but with that said I obviously am aiming for a swift entry into the market place.</p>
<p>What do I mean by a colourful journey? - The moment of completion, when you look at your creation whether it is a button or an entire app/website this is the greatest feeling imaginable.</p>
